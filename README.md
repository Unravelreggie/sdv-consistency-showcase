# SDV · Case consistency — synthetic public showcase

A synthetic illustration of source-to-record consistency, evidence provenance and manual-review routing. OCR and LLM extraction are represented by fabricated fields; this demo does not call either service.

This public repository contains **independently written demonstration code and entirely fabricated fixtures**. It is not a sanitized copy of a production system. No private Git history, company implementation, operational records, real study results, licensed terminology/templates, screenshots, secrets or infrastructure configuration are included.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.13 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The development server binds to local loopback. The application makes no runtime network requests, has no accounts and accepts no uploaded files. It is independently buildable and has no dependency on another project or data directory.

## What to explore

- Source evidence
- Structured candidates
- Deterministic checks
- Human review

English and Chinese interfaces are provided. Every displayed example and calculated demo value is synthetic. Browser actions do not create real review records or provide production authorization.
